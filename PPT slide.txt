SLIDE 1: TITLE PAGE
- Project Title: FoodBridge
- Tagline: Bridging the Gap Between Surplus and Success
- Purpose: A Real-time Strategic Food Redistribution Platform
- Team Name: EcoLogic Devs
- Presenters: Mihir Sharma, Md Irfan, Parijat Das, Syed Qasim
- Context: Hackathon Project Submission / Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger

SLIDE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT
- The Paradox: Millions of tons of edible food are discarded daily by restaurants and grocery stores, while local communities face severe food insecurity.
- The Logistics Gap: Small-to-medium donors lack a low-friction, real-time method to notify nearby NGOs about surplus availability.
- The Reality: Fresh, cooked food has a narrow window of safety; without an instant connection, it inevitably ends up in landfills.
- Core Issue: Lack of specialized, reliable, and real-time connective tissue in the local food donation ecosystem.

SLIDE 3: PROPOSED SOLUTION
- Solution: FoodBridge - A dedicated web application serving as a digital connective tissue for instant food redistribution.
- Instant Matchmaking: Donors post surplus items (quantity, type, expiry) in under 30 seconds; local NGOs receive instant updates.
- Streamlined Onboarding: Specialized digital dashboards for Donors (Restaurants/Stores) and NGOs (Charities/Community Centers) ensures role-specific workflows.
- Low Friction: Modern web-app design prioritizing speed and reliability to maximize the volume of rescued food.

SLIDE 4: KEY PRODUCT FEATURES
- Multiple Item Support: Donors can group different food types in a single post with individual quantity tracking.
- Visual Dietary Indicators: Green/Red coding for Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian items to ensure religious and dietary sensitivity.
- Real-Time Expiry Management: Visual badges alert NGOs to "Safe for Pickup" vs. "Expiring Soon" windows.
- Smart Safety Features: 15-minute cancellation window with live countdown timers to prevent logistics planning errors.
- Identity Trust: Role-based contact sharing once a donation is claimed to facilitate secure coordination.

SLIDE 5: TECHNICAL APPROACH
- Frontend Architecture: Built with React.js and TypeScript for a type-safe, high-performance user experience.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion utilized for a state-of-the-art, responsive glassmorphism UI.
- Backend & Real-time Data: Firebase Cloud Firestore for instantaneous data synchronization across users.
- Secure Authentication: Firebase Auth integrated with custom Firestore-based password recovery via security questions for higher reliability.
- State Management: Context API for seamless data flow between dashboards and core donation logic.

SLIDE 6: FEASIBILITY & REAL-WORLD IMPACT
- Low-Cost Scalability: Cloud-native serverless architecture allows the platform to scale from a single neighborhood to an entire city with minimal overhead.
- Environmental Benefit: Measurable reduction in methane emissions by diverting organic waste from local landfills.
- Social Benefit: Strengthening local community ties and directly supporting hungry populations via established NGO networks.
- Economic Advantage: Potential tax-deduction tracking for restaurant donors and reduced procurement costs for NGOs.

SLIDE 7: VISION & CONCLUSION
- The Future Roadmap:
    * AI Integration & Route Optimization: Predictive ML models for waste reduction and smart logistics.
    * Real-Time GPS Tracking: Live location sharing for seamless food pickups.
    * Dedicated Mobile Application: Native iOS/Android apps for instant push notifications and on-the-go management.
    * Institutional Partnerships: Integration with Government and municipal food safety systems for city-wide impact.
- Summary: FoodBridge isn't just a database; it's a movement towards a zero-waste society.
- Call to Action: Help us turn surplus food into a community asset.
- Closing: "Connecting those who have too much with those who have too little."
